## 1.Algorithm

1. ##### Question:

Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).



Example 1:

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```



Example 2:

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

Example 3:

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

##### 2.solution:

```
public static int getMaxProfits(int[] prices) {
    if (prices == null || prices.length <= 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;
    int max = 0;
    while (i < prices.length && j < prices.length) {
        while (j < prices.length - 1 && prices[j] < prices[j + 1]) {
            j++;
        }

        max += prices[j] - prices[i];
        if (j == prices.length - 1) {
            break;
        }
        i=j+1;
        j=j+1;

    }
    return max;
}
```
## 2.Review

​	this week  I wanna share an anticle about team-building :

[Why team-building exercises won’t make your staff more productive](https://medium.com/swlh/why-team-building-exercises-wont-make-your-staff-more-productive-f5a1d5223a8f)

​	Here are key points of this article:

#### 	1. Nourishment

​		

#### 	2. Independence

​		“*The antidote to fear is trust, and we all have a desire to find something to trust in an uncertain world. Fear and trust are powerful forces, and while they are not opposites, exactly, trust is the best tool for driving out fear*.” 

#### 	 3. Time	

- <u>Focus</u>

- <u>Low churn</u>
- <u>Growth and learning.</u>

#### 	4. Space

​	“*If you want to fire up your team, you’ve got to give them room to breathe. You need to loosen the physical and emotional constraints that hold them back and hem them in.*”

#### 	5. Warmth

​	

## 3.Tip

​	This week, I got a plan to update one table of our project.

​	 **solution1:**	

```
#将开过户和勾选了对公或对私账户的企业的资质类型更新为02（企业类型）
UPDATE dlcompany.dl_biz_base_info b
SET b.qualifications_type = '02'
WHERE
	b.company_id IN (
		SELECT DISTINCT
			(user_id) AS company_id
		FROM
			dlpay.dl_payment_account_info
		WHERE
			pay_mechanism = '04'
		AND logic_delete_flg = '0'
		UNION
			SELECT DISTINCT
				(company_id) AS company_id
			FROM
				dlcompany.dl_company_switch
			WHERE
				property_id = 'account_open_switch_status'
			AND property_value != '00'
	)
```

​	unfortunately, the sql of  solution 1 cost 88seconds. That's terrible for updating data.

​	EXPLAIN the sql ,   DEPENDENT SUBQUERY  appears in select type.  Mysql will execute the main sql first, then the sub_query.  So it is so terrible.

​         the table **'dl_biz_base_info'** had 10000 records and  

​	 **dl_payment_account_info**  had   200 records when the sub_query 's conditions were satisfied .

​	So, when the update sql is excuted,   it will iterating 10000 times  to match the other 200 records.  It cost 10000*200 times query. It's stupid.



**solution2:**

```
UPDATE dlcompany.dl_biz_base_info b
INNER JOIN (
	SELECT DISTINCT
		(user_id) AS company_id
	FROM
		dlpay.dl_payment_account_info
	WHERE
		pay_mechanism = '04'
	AND logic_delete_flg = '0'
	UNION
		SELECT DISTINCT
			(company_id) AS company_id
		FROM
			dlcompany.dl_company_switch
		WHERE
			property_id = 'account_open_switch_status'
		AND property_value != '00'
) a ON a.company_id = b.company_id
SET b.qualifications_type = '02'
```

 	In this solution, by the inner join ,the sql only cost 0.019senconds.   

​	pretty good.

## 4.share

​	This week ,I'd like to share an artile of Chen Hao. [How to start a free Https  for your website ](https://coolshell.cn/articles/18094.html).

​	Why shall we start a Https for our website? The answer is absolutely  about safety. The scheme we use  is  [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)

​	Here are  main steps:

1. lauch [https://certbot.eff.org](https://certbot.eff.org/)

2. choose your system and web software(such as nginx)

     I use centos 7 and  nginx

3. Do  as the tips mentioned  on the next page.		

     Rencently I get my own website (https://m.pokerbean.xyz)which is used to get housing message of Chengdu.  After read that article , I started Https service for my site. Pretty Easy. Thanks to Mr.Chen. 

 	The next step , I want to know more about   the underlying principles  Http/Https.	im Looking for  good article about this.
