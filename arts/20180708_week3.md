# 1.Algorithm

## Question:

Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

**Example:**
Given s = "hello", return "olleh".



**Solution:**



```
class Solution {
    public String reverseString(String origStr) {
        if (origStr.length()<=1) {
            return origStr;
        }
        char[] chars = origStr.toCharArray();
        char[] charArray= new char[origStr.length()];
        for (int i = 0; i <origStr.length() ; i++) {
            charArray[chars.length-i-1]=chars[i];
    	}
    return new String(charArray);
	}
}
```

### 	a trap of mysql 「order by 」 and 「limit」

Last week,I found a trap of mysql  in my work. We usually use  「order by 」 to make query result in  a sequential status. 



Suppose that we have a table named  'user' ;

```
CREATE TABLE `linker_user` (
  `id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `name` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
  `create_time` timestamp(4) NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(4) 
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
```

Excute the sql,

Query page 1:

`select * from user order by create_time limit 0,2;`

Query page 4:

`select * from user order by create_time limit 6,2;`



you will find  the same result  appear in both page 4 and page 1 .



 [Mysql offical Documention](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/limit-optimization.html ): 

- ```
  If you combine `LIMIT *row_count*` with `ORDER BY`, MySQL stops sorting as soon as it has found the first *row_count*rows of the sorted result, rather than sorting the entire result. If ordering is done by using an index, this is very fast. If a filesort must be done, all rows that match the query without the `LIMIT` clause are selected, and most or all of them are sorted, before the first *row_count* are found. After the initial rows have been found, MySQL does not sort any remainder of the result set.
  ```

  ```
  If you combine `LIMIT *row_count*` with `DISTINCT`, MySQL stops as soon as it finds *row_count* unique rows.
  
  
  ```

  

  

  Mysql gave the solution:

  

  ```
  If it is important to ensure the same row order with and without `LIMIT`, include additional columns in the `ORDER BY`clause to make the order deterministic. For example, if `id` values are unique, you can make rows for a given `category`value appear in `id` order by sorting like this:
  ```

   

  add an additional column id  in thr 「order by」 clauese， the result is right. 

  ```
  SELECT * FROM ratings ORDER BY category, id LIMIT 0,2
  ```

This week I wanna share an article about   **JWT** (JSON Web Token) .

[理解JWT的使用场景和优劣](http://blog.didispace.com/learn-how-to-use-jwt-xjf/)。

Here are some key points:



1. #### The conception of  「encoding」 ，「signature」,「encryption」

2. #### what kind of scene is suitable for JWT?

- one-time authentication
- stateless authentication of restful API
- sso +session management(no-recomended)



3. #### the relation of jwt, oauth2,session



 

 

summary: 

 	jwt 

	1. restful api :   yes
	2. replace session : risk exists.
