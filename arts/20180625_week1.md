### 1.  Algorithm 
```
    Algorithm is the weakest point of me. 
    My English RWLS(读写听说) is poor too. But there is no excuse permmited .
    So I decided use my poor English to do the Algorithm of this week.
    The difficulty level of Algorithm is rookie. I accept your laughing. 

```




    ** Question :** 
```    
     Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length. 
    Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
```


 _Example 1:_ 
```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```


 _Example 2:_ 
```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
Clarification:

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
```

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```




 **Solution :**


-    In the funtion(removeDuplicates) 
-    First ,   create a new resultList to save the the nums which removed the duplicates.
-    Iterate the  original array (nums).  In everytime's loop,   if resultList does not contains the num[i] ,push num[i] into resultList. 
      So that we can remove the duplicated numbers  . Then mark the last index as 'i +1'; 
-    when the iterator is over, print the whole new array which removed duplicate number .
-    return the result(resultList's size) 
```
 public class RemoveDuplicateNumber {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
        int [] array ={1,2,3,4,1,1,2,3,4};
        int i = removeDuplicates(array);
        System.out.println(i);
        }

        private static int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
            if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            List<Integer> resultList= new ArrayList<>();
            int last= 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <nums.length ; i++) {
                if (!resultList.contains(nums[i])) {
                    resultList.add(nums[i]);
                    nums[resultList.size()-1]=nums[i];
                    last =i+1;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(Arrays.copyOfRange(nums,0,last)));
            return resultList.size();
        }
}
```

### 3.  Technique or Tips

    As you knows，InteliJ IDEA is a popular IDE of Java Development. 
    Developers like do their development in a non-Mouse way.So IDE's shortcuts is one of these solutions.
    This week, I'd like to share some technique of InteliJ IDEA.
    
        (1). quickly start an action.
            There' s some operation that IDEA does not supply for us. People like to define shortcuts by themself in their comfortable way. there are some problems we have:
    
            -  sometimes our self-def shortcuts always conflict to other apps. 
            -  self-def shortcuts is hard to remember


​            
        Perhaps we can do it in other way, start our action by quick start 
        press   crtl+shift+A   to open a  quick start pannel like  this 
        you can rebuild project, do your git pull operation or other action you want.

        (2) quick search your Controller method.
            In a java project, there are always a lot Http or Restful methods in the Controller Layer. When we search a method , We always use Find in global，Find in path.   
         press ctrl+shift+alt+n , you can find your Controller method more efficiently.

        (3) Inject language
            If you edit your JSON String in your IDEA,you'll find it's stupid to mannually edit Escape symbol ,such as '/',one by one   .   
            IDEA provides Inject Language to Escape JSON String automatically .
            move your cursor on JSON String
            Press alt+Enter  
            choose Inject Language or reference  :JSON 
            then you can edit your JSON 
            there are so many fragments you can inject other language. Quite convenient！

   最近接触了SpringBoot,它除了自动装配配置的便捷之外，在很多时候需要基于注解来开发。注解不仅增加了代码的可读性，还增加了开发的速度。这也是我们使用SpringBoot的原因之一。
   由于SpringBoot大量的使用了注解，再加上自己平时对这方面基础知识不够重视，所以决定阅读一篇这方面的文章。

   <br/>
   本文出自方志鹏的博客，非常基础:

[ https://blog.csdn.net/forezp/article/details/78026146](http://)
    
​    
    这篇文章着重介绍了Java 5.0定义的4个标准的元注解，如下：
    
    @Target
    @Retention
    @Documented
    @Inherited
    
    并阐述了他们的作用和用法。
    在实战中，我们常常也将Java的反射与注解结合在一起，如AOP等。
    文中也有提到大家熟悉的ORM框架Mybatis,文章中模拟了Mybatis
    @Table @Colum的实现。

    真当自己要下笔写东西时，才明白自己平时所谓的那些“掌握”，还有那跛脚别扭的英文，是多么的匮乏的和可笑.
若是永远停留在对框架、语言的所谓‘知其然，不知其所以然’的层面，在真刀真枪的挑战中，是成不了气候的。
输出内容真的是一个不错的办法和选择，作为内容的输出者，作者会不自觉地对内容进行更深的思考打磨。
还可以不断增强作者的成就感和信心。也许这就是ARTS的意义所在吧。
希望能不断的和大家一起进步！
